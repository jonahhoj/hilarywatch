# hilarywatch

This site provides up-to-date information on Hurricane Hilary, both using the storm track and traffic cameras in California. While the images will no longer function after the storm's dissapation, since they're sourced from the NHC and Tropical Tidbits, the traffic cams are sourced from Caltrans and will stay connected. This allows for an easy fork of the project to account for future storm activity on the California coast.
